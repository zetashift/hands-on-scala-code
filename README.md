# hands-on-scala-code
Code and exercises solutions for the Li Haoyi's excellent Hands on Scala!

# Things I've learned

- Practical Scala advice that were covered in the first few chapters
- How to implement certain algorithms in scala
- Parsing
- Ammonite & Mill
- Async using Futures and parallel programming in Scala
- Web scraping and querying web API's
- Metals and Ammonite script need a comment in VSCode to specifiy which Scala version to use

# Notes

A lot was also done with Ammonite, so the code isn't complete.

I had to use WSL2 for this, so running the code isn't easy, this repo is more for a quick reference anyway!
